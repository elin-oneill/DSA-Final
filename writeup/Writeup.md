## Overview

## PageRank Algorithm
### What is it and how does it work?
The PageRank algorithm is an algorithm previously used by Google to rank and display websites on their platform. PageRank considers the number of links to a page as well as the quality of those links in order to determine how important a website is. Each page is assigned a number that represents how important it is within the dataset. Larger numbers therefore represent more “important” pages, while smaller numbers are less “important.”
